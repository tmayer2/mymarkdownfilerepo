What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)

The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit you made or the last 
commit that was checked out into your working directory.
